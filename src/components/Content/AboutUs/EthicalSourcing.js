                Conflict-Free Diamond Policy 
            </p>
            <p className='para'>
                Luxury Gems Company, along with the global diamond industry, has a zero-tolerance policy toward conflict diamonds. 
                Through measures such as the Kimberley Process, which tracks diamonds from the mine to the market, the industry in partnership with the United Nations, governments, and non-governmental organizations, polices diamond exports to prevent the trade of illegal diamonds. 
                At Luxury Gems Company, we only purchase diamonds through the largest and most respected suppliers who, like us, proudly adhere to and enforce the standards established by the Kimberley Process. 
                All Luxury Gems Company diamonds are warranted to be conflict free. 
                If one of our suppliers was ever found to be in violation of that process, we would immediately sever that relationship. 
                We will continue to support and promote any process that works to uphold legitimacy in the diamond trade. Diamonds are mined throughout the world, including major mines in Australia, Africa, Russia and Canada. Diamonds are a major source of good in many African nations, employing and providing healthcare to thousands.
