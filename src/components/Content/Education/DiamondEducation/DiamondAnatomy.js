      <p>
        Diamond has five main parts that define its shape and radiance. It is a
        good idea to understand these important components before selecting a
        diamond:
      </p>
      <h2>Table : </h2>
      <p>
        The flat surface at the top of the diamond. This is the largest facet of
        the diamond. The table percentage is the ratio of the width of the
        diamond's top facet in relation to the width of the entire stone. When
        the table percentage is in the correct ratio, it will produce a large
        amount of fire and brilliance.
      </p>
      <h2>Crown : </h2>
      <p>
        The top portion of a diamond measured from the girdle to the table. This
        is the top portion of the diamond (the 'table'), located above the
        girdle (the widest point of the diamond) and extending below the table.
        A diamond's crown extends from the top of the stone down to the girdle.
        Crowns can have either step cut facets or brilliant cut facets.
      </p>
      <h2>Girdle : </h2>
      <p>
        It is the narrow rim around the widest part of a diamond. This section
        is the intersection of the pavilion (bottom portion of the diamond)
        which defines the circumference of a diamond. It is also referred to as
        the setting edge because the girdle is where a diamond is held when set
        in jewelry.
      </p>
      <h2>Pavilion : </h2>
      <p>
        The bottom portion of a diamond, extending from the girdle to the culet.
        The pavilion bridges the girdle and the culet (point) and form at the
        bottom (culet). The pavilion is essential to the stone's light
        reflecting properties. A well cut pavilion allows maximum amount of
        light to reflect from the surface of the stone. An excessive deep or
        shallow cut diamond makes the light to escape out of the bottom and
        sides, reducing its sparkle.
      </p>
      <h2>Culet : </h2>
      <p>
        The facet at the tip of a gemstone. The preferred culet is not visible
        with the unaided eye (graded "none" or "small"). This small facet was
        originally intended to protect the diamond's pavilion, although today's
        settings are usually strong enough and makes this feature unnecessary.
      </p>
      <h2>Facet : </h2>
      <p>
        The flat planes or surfaces that you see on the geometric shape of the
        diamond is called a facet. Each part or facet of the diamond has its own
        contribution towards the diamond’s appearance. The facets are arranged
        in such a way to ensure that the right amount of light enters and
        reflects from the diamond. The facets on a crown and pavilion are
        completely different when compared to the symmetry and the proportion of
        a diamond.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table facet gathers light from above and either reflects it back or
        directs it into the diamonds interior. The crown facets gather and
        disperse light to create fire. The function of a crown is to allow as
        much light into a diamond as possible. The pavilion facets take the
        light to create fire. The pavilion facets take the light that comes in
        through the crown and direct it back to the viewer’s eye. The girdle
        makes an important contribution of its own by providing a location so
        that the diamond can be secured into a setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on a brilliant cut diamond you will see the stone consists
        of 58 facets; the crown of the diamond has 33 facets on the top part of
        the girdle and 24 on the pavilion, which is underneath the girdle and
        the culet is the one last facet.
