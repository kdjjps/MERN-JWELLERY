          <p>
            Asscher cut was first introduced in 1902 but has since modified for
            greater brilliance. Due to this unique faceting pattern, Asscher
            Cuts glimmer, like a hall of mirrors, as opposed to the traditional
            “sparkle” of round diamonds. The sleek clean look of this cut
            highlights the diamonds clarity, color and flawlessness.usually the
            recommended length-to-width ratio for asscher cuts is 1.00-1.05.

            Also known as the pillow cut, this cut has been adorning the fingers
            of brides for centuries with its curved sides and rounded corners.
            Some cushion cut diamonds have a “crushed ice” look which the
            sparkle is similar to a radiant or princess cut diamonds. While
            other cushion cut diamonds sparkle more like an excellent cut round
            brilliant. Personal taste is the deciding factor on which type of
            sparkle you prefer. But most clients usually pick the cushion
            brilliant look sparkle over the crushed ice look.

          <p>
            The heart shaped diamond is the essence of romance. It is also a
            very flattering style for larger fingers. There are good reasons why
            this is one of the rarest of diamond shapes for engagement rings. A
            well-shaped heart requires a large diamond, at least one-half carat.
            In addition, inclusions tend to be more prominent in this shape, so
            you want a diamond that has good clarity. Symmetry is also key: The
            well-rounded lobes should match in size and shape, as well as
            faceting style, and the cleft between them (as well as the point)
            should be well defined. The standard length to width ratio is
            between .90 and 1.10.

            An attractive, elongated shape with a royal pedigree, the marquise
            (pronounced “mahr-keez”) was supposedly named for the Marquise de
            Pompadour, a mistress of King Louis XV, as its outline resembled the
            shape of her mouth. Because of its shape, a marquise diamond ring
            will look larger face up than a round diamond of the same weight. A
            marquise diamond engagement ring can also make the finger appear
            longer and more slender. Usually the recommended length to width
            ratio for marquise is 1.75 and 2.25.

            Although a shape that is many hundreds of years old, the oval
            diamond has gained popularity for engagement rings in recent years
            because of its elegance and the fire it shows when cut in the
            brilliant faceting style. In addition, with its greater surface
            area, an oval diamond may appear larger than a round brilliant
            diamond of the same weight (and, like rectangular and marquise
            diamonds, can help elongate shorter fingers). One advantage over
            other fancy shapes is that the rounded edges make it less prone to
            chipping.Oval shaped diamonds, along with other elongated fancy
            shaped diamonds, may display a bow-tie effect to a certain degree.
            the bow- tie on a well-cut oval diamond will be minimal. The
            recommended length-to-width ratio is between 1.33 and 1.66.

            56 symmetrically placed triangular and kite-shaped facets, a table
            facet and an optional culet facet, for a total of 57 or 58
            facets.The perfect version of a round brilliant cut diamond exhibits
            the Hearts and Arrows phenomenon. Such diamonds are cut with utmost
            precision and possess superior characteristics; their facets are
            ideally aligned, displaying the pattern of eight hearts and eight
            arrows.
